# Bachelor Project
Bachelor Thesis at Delft University of Technology by Joost Bus

**Topic**: Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

## Project
I implemented QAOA using a heuristic approach in optimising the parameters, as proposed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01041) by Zhou et alii, in particular I looked at the INTERP method. Thereafter, I will compare its performance to the best classical algorithm by [Goemans-Williamson](http://www-math.mit.edu/~goemans/PAPERS/maxcut-jacm.pdf), similar to what was done [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08419) by G.E. Crooks (but with another way of optimizing the parameters). 

## What to find here?
- **Implementation** - The implementation can be found in the folder [Implementation](https://github.com/soosub/bep/tree/master/Implementation).

- **Status quo** - Have a look at the folder [Status-quo](https://github.com/soosub/bep/tree/master/Status-quo) for topics I struggle with and don't quite understand (yet). In the folder [Meetings](https://github.com/soosub/bep/tree/master/Status-quo/Meetings) I try to keep track of the discussions with my supervisors and set goals for the next meeting.

- **Reading material** - Reading material can be found in the folder [Read-up](https://github.com/soosub/bep/tree/master/Read-up). These are articles, blogs, and talks I have read/seen, or intend to read/see.
