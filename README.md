# Bachelor Project
Bachelor Thesis at Delft University of Technology by Joost Bus

**Topic**: Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

## Project
I implemented QAOA using a heuristic approach in optimising the parameters, as proposed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01041) by Zhou et alii, in particular I looked at the INTERP method. Thereafter, I will compare its performance to the best classical algorithm by [Goemans-Williamson](http://www-math.mit.edu/~goemans/PAPERS/maxcut-jacm.pdf), similar to what was done [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08419) by G.E. Crooks (but with another way of optimizing the parameters). 

## What to find here?
- **Implementation** - The implementation can be found in the folder [Implementation](https://github.com/soosub/bep/tree/master/Implementation).
